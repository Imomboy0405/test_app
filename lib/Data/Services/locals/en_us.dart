  "articleContent0": "#### Information about heart health\nThe vessels that supply blood to the heart are called coronary arteries. Blockage can occur in them due to the deposition of fat along their inner walls. This is called atherosclerosis. Because of this blockage, less blood reaches the heart muscle, and this can cause a heart attack. This is the leading cause of death in postmenopausal women. Arteries are more often blocked after menopause and with age. High blood pressure and high levels of fat in the blood (cholesterol andtriglycerides) increase the likelihood of developing atherosclerosis. High blood pressure is more common after menopause/with age.\n\nThe level of fat in the blood can increase with insufficient physical activity, unhealthy diet, and weight gain. You should check your blood pressure regularly and as often as your doctor advises.\n\n##### To assess the condition of your heart, it is recommended to conduct the following minimal studies:\nBlood pressure:\n\nBlood fats:\n- Total cholesterol\n- Low-density lipoproteins (LDL)\n- High-density lipoproteins (HDL)\n- Triglycerides.\n\n##### You are at increased risk of heart disease if you:\n**Age**: Age-related risk increases with age, then the highest risk is for those over 65 years of age.\n\n**Family history**: History of heart attack in father or brother before they turned 55, or in mother/sister before they turned 65.\n\n**Age at menopause**: Women who reach menopause before the age of 40 are at the greatest risk. If menopause occurred at a younger age, the risk is higher.\n\n**Body mass index**: The higher the body mass index (BMI), the higher the risk. BMI above 23 kg/m2 if you are of Asian descent, and above 25 kg/m2 if you are not of Asian descent, increases the risk of heart disease.\n\n**Waist circumference**: Has the lowest risk if it is less than 89 cm (35 inches), the highest if it is more than 114 cm (45 inches).\n\n**Systolic blood pressure**: The lowest risk if systolic blood pressure is less than 120 mmHg. Higher risk if it exceeds 140 mmHg.\n\n**Body fats**: Abnormal readings increase the risk of heart disease, but with physical activity and medications, the readings can be improved.\n\n**Diabetes**: The presence of diabetes increases the risk, which increases even more if the blood sugar level is not controlled (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] > 7).\n\n**Physical activity**: The lowest risk with higher physical activity (more than 150 minutes of moderate activity per week or 75 minutes of active movement per week). The highest risk if physical activity is less than 30 minutes per week.\n\n**Smoking**: Smokers (current andformer smokers) are at higher risk.\n\n\n###### Please consult a doctor if you believe you are at increased risk of heart disease.",
  "articleContent1": "#### Information about diabetes\nHigh blood glucose levels indicate diabetes. Diabetes is common among women in postmenopause and poses a serious health problem with significant complications. Increased abdominal fat is associated with menopause and increases the risk of developing diabetes. The risk of heart disease nearly doubles in women with diabetes. However, good diabetes control can reduce the risk of diabetic complications. If you have a moderate or high risk of developing diabetes, you should consult a doctor and continue regular monitoring for diabetes prevention and control, as well as its complications.\n\n##### Recommended tests for diabetes screening\n- Fasting blood glucose level\n- Postprandial blood glucose level (2 hours after eating)\n- HbA1c. This is a special diabetes test that provides insight into blood sugar levels over the past 3 months.\n\n##### You are at increased risk of developing diabetes if:\n**High blood sugar levels**: If elevated blood sugar levels are detected at any time or during pregnancy, the risk of developing diabetes increases.\n\n**Age**: The highest risk is over 65 years old and the lowest risk is under 45 years old.\n\n**BMI**: Risk increases with higher BMI, more than 23 kg/m¬≤ for people of Asian origin and more than 25 kg/m¬≤ for those of non-Asian origin.\n\n**Waist circumference**: The highest risk is if it exceeds 88 cm (35 inches), the lowest risk is if it is less than 80 cm (31 inches).\n\n**Physical activity**: The lowest risk is with higher physical activity (more than 150 minutes of moderate activity per week or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week), the highest risk is if less than 30 minutes per week.\n\n**Family history of diabetes**: Having diabetes in your parents, siblings, or children represents the highest risk of developing diabetes, and there is even a significant risk if grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins have diabetes.\n\n###### Please consult a doctor if you believe you are at increased risk for diabetes.",
  "articleContent2": "#### Information about done health\nOsteoporosis is a condition where your bones become brittle and can easily break (fracture). Fractures may be silent (without trauma) or occur with minimal trauma. These fractures can hinder your daily activities. Osteoporosis is more common in women than in men after the age of 45. A diet with sufficient calcium and vitamin D to protect the bones and adequate protein to maintain muscles can reduce the risk of fractures. Physical activity is also important for maintaining muscle strength and balance to prevent falls and fractures.\n\n##### Recommended bone health test is the T-score DXA, which measures bone density:\n- Lumbar spine - spine\n- Femoral neck - hip\n- Radius - bone in the arm\n\n##### The following may affect your bone health and increase the risk of fractures:\n**Underweight**:\n- BMI is your weight adjusted for your height.\n- BMI is used to assess whether a person is underweight, optimal weight, or overweight.\n- A BMI less than 18.5 kg/m¬≤ is considered underweight for Caucasians.\n- Underweight individuals have a higher likelihood of brittle bones and increased fracture rates.\n\n**Food intolerances or gastrointestinal disorders**: Various gastrointestinal disorders, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, and other conditions, impair nutrient absorption and increase the likelihood of brittle bones.\n\n**Frequent falls**:\n- People with osteoporosis who frequently fall are at a higher risk of fractures.\n- Elderly people with health problems causing poor balance, people with muscle weakness/generalized weakness, people with difficulty standing/walking/balancing, and those with poor vision are at higher risk of falls and subsequent fractures.\n\n**Severe liver or kidney disease**: People with severe liver or kidney disease are at increased risk of bone loss and osteoporosis.\n\n**Chronic depression**: Depression has been associated with a higher risk of fractures in some studies. However, the use of antidepressants may be responsible for this increased risk.\n\n**Rheumatoid arthritis**: Rheumatoid arthritis is a joint disease that affects bone health and is associated with bone loss and osteoporosis.\n\n**Long-term corticosteroid therapy (e.g., prednisone)**:\n- Some people take medications called corticosteroids for long periods, especially those suffering from asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, or any other autoimmune diseases.\n- Both inhaled and oral steroids have been found to increase the risk of fractures in patients with osteoporosis.\n\n**Early menopause**: Early menopause increases the risk; those who reach menopause at less than 45 years old are at higher risk.\n\n##### You are at increased risk of osteoporosis if:\n**Age**: Risk increases with age.\n\n**Age at menopause**: Early menopause increases the risk; those who reach menopause at less than 45 years old are at higher risk. The highest risk is for women who reach menopause before 40 years old, especially those who have not taken any hormones (HRT or combined oral contraceptives).\n\n**History of previous fractures**: A history of previous fractures increases the risk.\n\n**Family history**: A history of hip fractures in one of your parents or any sibling increases the risk.\n\n**Smoking**: Those who currently smoke are at the highest risk, while non-smokers are at the lowest risk.\n\n**Alcohol**: Consuming more than 3 units of alcohol per week significantly increases the risk.\n\n**Bone-toxic medications**: Use of the following medications increases the risk of osteoporosis:\n- Antidepressants.\n- Medications for epilepsy (seizures).\n- Medications to reduce stomach acid.\n- Long-term corticosteroid therapy, as in asthma or rheumatoid arthritis.\n- Breast cancer medication that lowers estrogen levels.\n\n###### Please consult a doctor if you believe you are at increased risk for fractures due to brittle bones (osteoporosis).",
  "articleContent3": "#### Education\nMany women feel that their memory worsens during menopause, but this is usually not a cause for concern. Other common causes of memory disturbances include: age, stress, fatigue, anxiety, depression, medications, and poor health. Many women experience increased anxiety and poor mood during menopause. These symptoms may be alleviated by treatments such as behavioral therapy. Antidepressants are not needed for these symptoms.\n\n> International Menopause Society, 2014; NAMS, 2014; BMS, 2011.\n\n##### Alzheimer's Disease\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Alzheimer‚Äôs disease is rare before age 60 and is more common in women than men.\n\n> International Menopause Society, 2014; NAMS, 2014; BMS, 2011.\n\n###### You should consult a doctor to assess your cognitive disorders.",
  "articleContent4": "#### Breast cancer in postmenopausal women\n#### Information about breast cancer\nBreast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women. The risk of developing breast cancer increases with age, obesity, and family history of breast cancer. Monthly breast self-exams are important for early detection of breast cancer. If you find a lump in your breast, you should immediately consult a doctor. You should have a breast examination by a healthcare professional annually. In many countries, women undergo routine mammograms and/or breast ultrasounds (if indicated) or additional imaging as recommended by their doctors. Sometimes, a genetic test may be offered if there is a strong family history of breast cancer.\n\n##### The risk of developing breast cancer increases:\n- With age.\n- If you have a family history of breast cancer.\n- If you are obese, with a BMI of 30 kg/m¬≤.\n- If your first menstrual period occurred at an early age (10 years or younger).\n- If you had your first child at a later age (35 years or older).\n- If you have had benign breast disease.\n- If you have a positive genetic history of breast cancer.\n\n##### Recommended tests for breast cancer screening:\n- Breast self-examination: If you find a lump, skin changes, or nipple discharge, it is important to see a doctor for further evaluation, as these may be signs of early breast cancer.\n- Clinical breast examination by your doctor.\n- Mammogram.\n\n##### To perform a breast self-exam:\nLie down and place your left arm under your head. Use your right hand to examine your left breast. Using the pads of your three middle fingers, move gently in small circular motions around the breast, checking for lumps, hard knots, or thickening. Use varying levels of pressure‚Äîlight, medium, and firm‚Äîfor each area of your breast. Check the entire breast from the collarbone above the breast to the ribs below the breast. Switch hands and repeat the exam on the other breast. Look at your breasts in the mirror with your arms at your sides. Look for lumps, new differences in size and shape, and any swelling or dimpling of the skin. Raise one arm and check under your armpits for lumps. Repeat on the other side. Gently squeeze each nipple between your thumb and forefinger. Report any discharge or fluid from the nipples or any lumps or changes in your breasts to your doctor.\n\n###### Please consult a doctor if you believe you are at increased risk of breast cancer.",

  "attractionInfo_100": "Libido is one of the main concepts of human sexuality, characterizing the perception of one's own sexuality and the ability to express it. Your results show that you do not experience problems with expressing your sexuality, keep it up! Remember that aging affects every part of our body, which means that maintaining libido requires active prevention.",
  "excitationInfo_100": "Arousal is the first link in the cycle of sexual reactions that precedes the sexual act itself. Since it is in the arousal phase that the body prepares for the upcoming sexual act (clitoral erection, vaginal lubrication), any disruptions in the arousal phase are a catastrophe that will not allow a normal sexual contact to occur. According to your results, in the majority of cases, you did not have problems with arousal, but even rare episodes can be a signal of upcoming problems.",
  "lubricationInfo_100": "Lubrication is the process of moistening the vagina and its entrance under the influence of sexual stimulation (psychological or physical), achieved due to a powerful rush of blood to the walls of the vagina. Based on your results, you do not have problems with lubrication. It is important to note that as we age, lubrication problems arise as an early symptom!",
  "orgasmInfo_100": "Orgasm is an intense sensation of pleasure that creates an altered state of consciousness, accompanied by the contraction and relaxation of striated muscles, inducing sexual-induced vasocongestion (well-being/satisfaction). According to various sources, 30 to 79% of women experience problems with orgasm. You are lucky not to have any issues here!",
  "satisfactionInfo_100": "The level of satisfaction reflects your perception of the process of realizing sexual function, psycho-emotional, and physical discharge that occurs during the sequential passage through the cycle of sexual reactions (arousal, plateau, orgasm, and resolution). Disruptions in satisfaction indicate a dysfunction in sexual function and should be considered in the context of existing disturbances in other parameters, such as arousal, orgasm, or the presence of pain. Congratulations, according to your answers, you are completely satisfied with the quality of your sexual life, just try to maintain this level.",
  "painInfo_100": "Painful sexual dysfunctions are an important issue that affects more than 20% of women, including conditions such as vaginismus, dyspareunia, and vulvodynia. You are fortunate not to experience pain during intercourse. Make sure none of your friends or loved ones suffer from this issue either!",
  "attractionInfo_60": "Libido is one of the main concepts of human sexuality, characterizing the perception of one's own sexuality and the ability to express it. If you experience problems with sexual desire, they may be related to hormonal regulation issues, gynecological or somatic diseases, as well as psychosexual self-perception and interpersonal relationships with your partner.",
  "excitationInfo_60": "Arousal is the first link in the cycle of sexual reactions that precedes the sexual act itself. Since it is in the arousal phase that the body prepares for the upcoming sexual act (clitoral erection, vaginal lubrication), any disruptions in the arousal phase are a catastrophe that will not allow a normal sexual contact to occur.",
  "lubricationInfo_60": "Lubrication is the process of moistening the vagina and its entrance under the influence of sexual stimulation (psychological or physical), achieved due to a powerful rush of blood to the walls of the vagina. Insufficient lubrication leads to trauma and pain during penetrative intercourse. If you have a lubrication problem, it can be a symptom of many conditions, each of which needs to be addressed!",
  "orgasmInfo_60": "Orgasm is an intense sensation of pleasure that creates an altered state of consciousness, accompanied by the contraction and relaxation of striated muscles, inducing sexual-induced vasocongestion (well-being/satisfaction). According to various sources, 30 to 79% of women experience problems with orgasm. However, the absence of orgasm is not an unsolvable problem! There are methods and techniques that can improve the quality of sexual life and increase the likelihood of orgasm.",
  "satisfactionInfo_60": "The level of satisfaction reflects your perception of the process of realizing sexual function, psycho-emotional, and physical discharge that occurs during the sequential passage through the cycle of sexual reactions (arousal, plateau, orgasm, and resolution). Disruptions in satisfaction indicate a dysfunction in sexual function and should be considered in the context of existing disturbances in other parameters, such as arousal, orgasm, or the presence of pain.",
  "painInfo_60": "Painful sexual dysfunctions are an important issue that affects more than 20% of women, including conditions such as vaginismus, dyspareunia, and vulvodynia. If you experience pain during intercourse, it is not normal and you should not endure it! To solve the problem of painful sexual dysfunctions, make an appointment, and we will definitely find a solution to your problem.",
